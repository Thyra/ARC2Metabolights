# ARC2Metabolights
This is a script to save me some clicks when submitting data from an [ARC](https://arc-rdm.org/) to the [MetaboLights database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/).
It uses the MetaboLights's DB [REST API](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/ws/api/spec.html#!/spec).
It's currently just a [deno](https://deno.com/) script but hopes to maybe one day grow into a fully automated self-service portal, depending on how many submissions to MetaboLights I have to do ([Manual Work is a Bug!](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3197520&lid=92091woucb4y)).
